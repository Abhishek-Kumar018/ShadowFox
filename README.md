# Beginner Level Python Scripts

This repository contains a collection of beginner-level Python scripts demonstrating fundamental programming concepts.

## üìÅ Subdirectories

### 1. For Loops

* **1st.py**: This script simulates rolling a die multiple times. It counts the number of times a '6' or a '1' is rolled and also keeps track of how many times two '6's are rolled in a row.
* **2nd.py**: A script that guides a user through a set of jumping jacks, tracking their progress and allowing them to stop if they get tired.

### 2. If Condition

* **1st.py**: A Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator. It takes the user's height and weight as input and categorizes their BMI as "Obesity", "Overweight", "Normal", or "Underweight".
* **2nd.py**: This script identifies the country of a given city. It can identify cities in Australia, the UAE, and India based on predefined lists.
* **3rd.py**: This script checks if two cities entered by the user belong to the same country (from predefined lists for Australia, UAE, and India).

### 3. List

* **1.py**: This script demonstrates various list operations using a list of Justice League members. It shows how to:
    * Count the number of members.
    * Add new members.
    * Move a member to the beginning of the list.
    * Insert a new member at a specific position.
    * Replace the entire list with a new one.
    * Sort the list and identify a new leader.

### 4. Numbers

* **1st.py**: A simple script that demonstrates how to format a number into a different base (in this case, octal).
* **2nd.py**: This script calculates the area of a pond and the total volume of water it can hold.
* **3rd.py**: Calculates speed based on a given distance and time.

### 5. Variables

* **1st.py**: A basic script that assigns a value to the variable `pi` and then prints its value and data type.
* **2nd.py**: This script intentionally demonstrates a `SyntaxError` that occurs when a reserved keyword ('for') is used as a variable name.
* **3rd.py**: Calculates Simple Interest based on predefined Principal, Rate, and Time values.
