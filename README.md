# Beginner Level Python Scripts

This repository contains a collection of beginner-level Python scripts demonstrating fundamental programming concepts.

## üìÅ Subdirectories

### 1. For Loops

* **1st.py**: This script simulates rolling a die multiple times. It counts the number of times a '6' or a '1' is rolled and also keeps track of how many times two '6's are rolled in a row.
* **2nd.py**: A script that guides a user through a set of jumping jacks, tracking their progress and allowing them to stop if they get tired.

### 2. If Condition

* **1st.py**: A Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator. It takes the user's height and weight as input and categorizes their BMI as "Obesity", "Overweight", "Normal", or "Underweight".
* **2nd.py**: This script identifies the country of a given city. It can identify cities in Australia, the UAE, and India based on predefined lists.
* **3rd.py**: This script checks if two cities entered by the user belong to the same country (from predefined lists for Australia, UAE, and India).

### 3. List

* **1.py**: This script demonstrates various list operations using a list of Justice League members. It shows how to:
    * Count the number of members.
    * Add new members.
    * Move a member to the beginning of the list.
    * Insert a new member at a specific position.
    * Replace the entire list with a new one.
    * Sort the list and identify a new leader.

### 4. Numbers

* **1st.py**: A simple script that demonstrates how to format a number into a different base (in this case, octal).
* **2nd.py**: This script calculates the area of a pond and the total volume of water it can hold.
* **3rd.py**: Calculates speed based on a given distance and time.

### 5. Variables

* **1st.py**: A basic script that assigns a value to the variable `pi` and then prints its value and data type.
* **2nd.py**: This script intentionally demonstrates a `SyntaxError` that occurs when a reserved keyword ('for') is used as a variable name.
* **3rd.py**: Calculates Simple Interest based on predefined Principal, Rate, and Time values.


# Intermediate Level Python Scripts

This folder contains more advanced Python scripts that demonstrate concepts like web scraping and interactive games.

## üìú File Descriptions

### **Hangman.py**

This is a classic implementation of the **Hangman game**.

  * A random word is chosen from a predefined dictionary, and a hint is provided to the player.
  * The player has to guess the word letter by letter within a limited number of wrong guesses (6).
  * The script keeps track of guessed letters and displays the word with underscores for unguessed letters.

### **wiki\_scraper.py**

This script is a **web scraper** that extracts information about a person from their English Wikipedia page.

  * It takes a person's name as a command-line argument.
  * It fetches the corresponding Wikipedia page, parses the HTML, and extracts key information such as:
      * Full Name
      * Birth Date and Place
      * Death Date
      * Occupation
      * A brief biography
  * The extracted information is then saved to a text file (default is `output.txt`).

### **output.txt**

This is an **example output file** generated by the `wiki_scraper.py` script. It shows the information scraped for "Albert Einstein".

## üì¶ Packages & Dependencies

The Python scripts in this folder use a combination of standard libraries and third-party packages.

### Standard Libraries Used:

  * **`random`**: Used in `Hangman.py` to randomly select a word.
  * **`argparse`**: Used in `wiki_scraper.py` to handle command-line arguments.
  * **`dataclasses`**: Used in `wiki_scraper.py` to create a simple class for storing person information.
  * **`textwrap`**: Used in `wiki_scraper.py` to format the biography text neatly.
  * **`re`**: Used in `wiki_scraper.py` for regular expression operations to clean up text.

### Third-Party Packages Required:

You will need to install the following packages to run `wiki_scraper.py`. You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```

  * **`requests`**: A popular library for making HTTP requests to fetch web pages.
  * **`bs4` (BeautifulSoup)**: A library for parsing HTML and XML documents, making it easy to extract data from web pages.
